# `bujin-scheduler` ü•∑‚õ©Ô∏è

`bujin-scheduler` is a user service daemon in charge of scheduling your TaskWarrior backlog on your local computer to a CalDAV calendar of your choice.

## Theory of operations

This is an opinionated tool for my own needs, feel free to take it apart and adjust it for yours.

I have too many things to do and over so many platforms, to fill the puzzle, I am often in need of something that can understand:

(a) my fatigue level based on what I do
(b) reprioritization based on realtime (new) emergencies
(c) how to avoid my own burnout

Most todo lists does not have a concept of well-being, they are ultimately
focused on "get things done", which is great when you have natural protection
against burnout from your own body.

I, unfortunately, don't.

## Design

Most of the time, TaskWarrior is used as the long-term storage for everything I need to do:

- I log everything there
- If I need an automation, I just built a synchronizer

In addition, TaskWarrior often does not contain a deadline concept (sometimes, do, sometimes don't).

Whereas my calendar contains my manually input tasks and represents a
short-term horizon of what are the tasks I need to deal with on a daily basis.

This software is about moving parts of the long term storage to the short term
horizon in a clever way, taking into account the previous constraints.

### Scheduling v1

#### Parameters & definitions

There's an ideal energy level every day, let's say $E_{\text{ideal}}$.

A reasonably good day is defined as a day that (a) achieve the objectives (b) is not overworking the entity under the schedule (c) is not a bad day.

A good day is just a reasonably good day without (a) and (b).

The next day after a good day, the available energy level should not be too far from the ideal one. The next day after a bad day, the available energy level could be as low as 20 % or 50 % of the ideal.

#### Aims

(1) Schedule as many as urgent tasks under constraint of the energy levels and the 'status' of the day.
(2) Predict whether a day has been good or bad based on the remaining tasks scheduled.

#### Estimate a task energy level consumption

A task should have the right amount of metadata to be mappable to energy level:

- Prior existing energy level estimate should be taken into account
- UDA input on the difficulty level / time that it should take should be taken into account
- Attempt number on the task should be taken into account

## Alternatives

I tried https://github.com/bergercookie/syncall before and it seems very nice,
unfortunately, I am a NixOS developer and I need software to run on NixOS.

I tried hard but the latest release had a bunch of issues with imports (or my
mispackaging), so I gave up and decided that rewriting mine will be faster.

My scheduling component is anyway isolated so could be reused with syncall
directly without the rest of my opinionated stuff.
